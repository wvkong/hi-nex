This repository contains a clone of the landing page for the IT services website [hi-nex.com](https://www.hi-nex.com/ "HI-NEX - IT Solutions and Services Company"), built using Next.js and optimized for faster image loading.

### Project Goals:

* Replicate the visual design and key functionalities of the original landing page.
* Implement image optimization techniques to improve page load speed.
* Gain practical experience with Next.js and front-end development best practices.
### Technologies Used:

* Front-end: Next.js, React, HTML, CSS (SCSS)
* Image Optimization: Next.js Image component, sharp (image resizing), image compression tools (optional)
### Features:

* Hero section with background image and text overlay
* Service overview section with icons and descriptions
* Testimonials section with client quotes and avatars
### Image Optimization:

This clone prioritizes faster loading times by implementing several image optimization techniques:

* Next.js Image component: Utilizes built-in image handling for automatic image optimization based on screen size and device type.
* Sharp: Image resizing library allows dynamically resizing images for different screen sizes without quality loss.
* Image Compression: Additional compression tools (e.g., WebP, lossless JPEG) can be implemented to further reduce image file sizes.
